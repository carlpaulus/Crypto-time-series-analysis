PLANNING OF THE CRYPTO_FORECASTING TOOL DEVELOPMENT

Topic chosen: "Cryptocurrency time-series analysis"

packages: yfinance (easier) or cryptocompare (trickier but price-per-seconds available)

#################### PART 1 ####################

--> Determine the dataset
    - choose the cryptos to work on. Maybe build some portfolios of cryptos later on.
    - data in days, hours, seconds ? Which one is the most reliable to forecast the coming seconds, hours or days
    - start & end dates should be parameters

--> Run statistics:
    - calculate basic stats : annualized returns & volatility, correlation between different cryptos, max drawdown,
      calmar ratio (ann. returns / max drawdown), ann. Sharpe ratio ((Rp-Rf)/std), heatmap and clustermap (seaborn package)
    - compare results of a regular SMA trading strategy and the WML strategy (wml overweights recent prices)
    - Try the same on volumes instead of prices (creation of a technical indicator) = VOLUME-WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE

#################### PART 2 #################### (we can do it for prices and volumes)

--> Dimensionality reduction (especially if we use the "seconds" dataset)
    - random projection, PCA/SVD or Autoencoders

--> Regression
    - linear regression, least-square method, coef of determination (is it to calculate the error?), non-linear regression
    - optimization with chapter 4.5 "Interlude: Solving systems of equations numerically" of the Data Analytics course ?
        + Find which training period is the best to forecast future prices

--> Underfitting/Overfitting check ?

--> Classification ?
